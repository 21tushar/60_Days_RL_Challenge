Hi, I'm finally committed to learn **Deep Reinforcement Learning** in depth, in 60 days!!

**Do you want to take on this challenge with me?**  

Aren't you convinced? Look at the works done by [Deepmind with AlphaGo Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&v=tXlM99xPQC8) and the bot developed by [OpenAI to play Dota 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l92J1UvHf6M)  

This repository wants to guide you throught the **Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms**, from the basic cross-entropy algorithm to the highly advanced AlphaGo Zero. You will found the main **topics organized by week and the resources suggested to learn them**. Also, every week I will provide for every topic, **pratical examples** implemented in python to help you better digest the theory. You are highly encouraged to modify them and implement by yourself.

Also, because this is my first project of this kind, please, if you have any idea, suggestion or improvement contact me at andrea.lonza@gmail.com.

NB: I choose a similar path to the one taken in the book [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Reinforcement-Learning-Maxim-Lapan/dp/1788834240)

During the whole challenge, I will continuously update this repository, so stay tuned!
