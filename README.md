### I designed this Challenge for you and me: Learn Deep Reinforcement Learning in depth in 60 days!!

You heard about the amazing results achieved by [Deepmind with AlphaGo Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&v=tXlM99xPQC8) and by [OpenAI in Dota 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l92J1UvHf6M)! Don't you want to know how they work?
This is the right opportunity for you and me to finally learn Deep RL and use it on new exciting projects.

> The ultimate aim is to use these general-purpose technologies and apply them to all sorts of important real world problems. 
> **Demis Hassabis**
<br>

This repository wants to guide you through the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, from the most basic ones to the highly advanced AlphaGo Zero. You will find the **main topics organized by week** and the **resources suggested to learn them**. Also, every week I will provide **practical examples** implemented in python to help you better digest the theory. You are highly encouraged to modify and play with them!

<br>

This is my first project of this kind, so please, if you have any idea, suggestion or improvement contact me at andrea.lonza@gmail.com.


During the whole challenge, I will continuously update this repository.. **so stay tuned**! #60DaysRLChallenge
